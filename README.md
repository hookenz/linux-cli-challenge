# The Linux CLI Challenge Project

Are you ready for a challenging learning project?

## The challenge

1. Choose a Linux command line tool of your choice.  
2. Reimplement it in the language of your choosing.

## Rules

1. This should not be a port and should not use automated tooling. 
2. Do not read the source code and simply translate or port the code into a new language.  
3. Actually look at the program behavior, the man page and the documentation and implement it from scratch.
4. Extra points for portability (Windows included).

## Why?

Learning should be challenging and fun. Unfortunately, most projects do not produce anything useful or simply aren't challenging enough.
The best way to learn is by doing and making lots of mistakes in implementation a long the way.  I gaurantee that by the time you've written a tool you'll be an expert in it.  You will also have something to showcase some of your skills.

Happy Coding!
